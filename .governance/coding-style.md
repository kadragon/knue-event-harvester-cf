# Coding Style

- Language: TypeScript (ESM). Prefer explicit exports and typed function signatures.
- Testing: Vitest. Use descriptive `describe/it` blocks and keep fixtures small.
- Formatting: Preserve existing file style (2-space indent where present). Avoid adding non-ASCII characters unless required for content.
