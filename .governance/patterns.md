# Reusable Patterns

- **Spec → Task → Implementation**: Define a spec entry, create a dated task folder, then implement with TDD, logging progress in `PROGRESS.md`.
- **Dependency Alignment**: Keep toolchains on matching major versions (e.g., Vitest core and coverage provider) to avoid CI peer conflicts.
