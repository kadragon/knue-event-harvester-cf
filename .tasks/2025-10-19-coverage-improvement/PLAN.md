# Test Coverage Improvement Plan

## Objective

Increase test coverage from 28% (2/7 modules) to 80%+ through systematic test implementation and coverage infrastructure setup.

---

## Current State

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Tested Modules** | 2/7 (28%) |
| **Total Tests** | 4 passing |
| **Coverage Tool** | ❌ Not installed |
| **Coverage Config** | ❌ Not configured |
| **CI/CD Pipeline** | ❌ Not configured |

### Tested Modules
- ✅ `src/lib/rss.ts` - RSS feed parsing
- ✅ `src/lib/dedupe.ts` - Deduplication logic

### Untested Modules
- ❌ `src/lib/calendar.ts` - Google Calendar API (HIGH PRIORITY)
- ❌ `src/lib/ai.ts` - OpenAI API integration (HIGH PRIORITY)
- ❌ `src/lib/preview.ts` - Preview content fetching
- ❌ `src/lib/html.ts` - HTML to text conversion
- ❌ `src/lib/state.ts` - KV state management
- ❌ `src/lib/index.ts` - Worker orchestration (integration test)

---

## Implementation Plan (4 Phases)

### Phase 1: Coverage Infrastructure Setup (Day 1)
**Goal:** Enable coverage reporting and set up quality gates

#### Tasks
1. **Install coverage dependency**
   - Command: `npm install --save-dev @vitest/coverage-v8`
   - Dependency: vitest v1.5.3 (already installed)

2. **Create `vitest.config.ts`**
   - Coverage provider: v8
   - Thresholds: 80% lines, 80% functions, 75% branches
   - Include: `src/lib/**/*.ts`
   - Exclude: `src/lib/types.ts`, `*.test.ts`
   - Report formats: `text`, `html`, `json`

3. **Add npm scripts**
   ```json
   "test:coverage": "vitest --run --coverage"
   "test:coverage:ui": "vitest --run --coverage --reporter=html"
   ```

4. **Update `.gitignore`** (if needed)
   - Ensure `coverage/` is ignored (already present)

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- `npm run test:coverage` runs successfully
- Coverage report generates in `coverage/` directory
- HTML report viewable in browser

---

### Phase 2: Test Implementation by Module
**Goal:** Write tests for 5 untested modules (60-70% of remaining coverage)

#### 2.1: `calendar.ts` Tests (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Scope:** Google Calendar API integration
- Mock Google Calendar API client
- Test event creation with enriched data
- Test conflict detection during event sync
- Test error handling (auth failures, rate limits)

**Tests to Write:** 5-8 test cases
**Estimated Coverage Gain:** +15%

#### 2.2: `ai.ts` Tests (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Scope:** OpenAI API integration
- Mock OpenAI API client
- Test content summarization
- Test OCR functionality on images
- Test error handling (API timeouts, invalid responses)
- Test token limiting

**Tests to Write:** 6-10 test cases
**Estimated Coverage Gain:** +12%

#### 2.3: `preview.ts` Tests
**Scope:** Preview content fetching
- Mock fetch requests
- Test HTML content extraction
- Test URL parsing and validation
- Test error handling (network failures, 404s)

**Tests to Write:** 4-6 test cases
**Estimated Coverage Gain:** +8%

#### 2.4: `html.ts` Tests
**Scope:** HTML to text conversion
- Test various HTML structures (lists, tables, nested divs)
- Test special characters and encoding
- Test edge cases (empty content, malformed HTML)

**Tests to Write:** 4-5 test cases
**Estimated Coverage Gain:** +6%

#### 2.5: `state.ts` Tests
**Scope:** KV state management
- Mock Cloudflare KV namespace
- Test state persistence (put/get)
- Test state expiration
- Test error handling (quota exceeded, access denied)

**Tests to Write:** 4-5 test cases
**Estimated Coverage Gain:** +5%

#### 2.6: `index.ts` Integration Tests (LOW PRIORITY)
**Scope:** Worker orchestration
- Mock all dependencies (RSS, Calendar, AI, Preview, State, HTML)
- Test end-to-end flow (scheduled trigger → RSS → processing → calendar sync)
- Test error recovery and logging

**Tests to Write:** 3-5 test cases
**Estimated Coverage Gain:** +8%

**Phase 2 Summary:**
- Total tests to write: ~30 test cases
- Expected total coverage: 80%+
- Duration: 3-4 days

---

### Phase 3: Coverage Validation & Optimization (Day 5)
**Goal:** Verify 80% threshold and identify coverage gaps

#### Tasks
1. Run coverage report
   - Command: `npm run test:coverage`
   - Verify threshold met (80%)
   - Identify remaining untested paths

2. Analyze coverage gaps
   - Review HTML report
   - Identify conditional branches not covered
   - Add edge case tests if gaps remain

3. Refactor for testability (if needed)
   - Extract complex logic into pure functions
   - Inject external dependencies (API clients, KV store)

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Coverage ≥ 80% across all metrics
- No untested error paths
- All modules have representative tests

---

### Phase 4: CI/CD Integration (Optional, Day 6)
**Goal:** Automate coverage checks in pipeline

#### Tasks
1. Create GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/test.yml`)
   - Run tests on `push` and `pull_request`
   - Enforce coverage threshold (block on <80%)
   - Comment coverage report on PRs

2. Update pre-commit hooks (Husky)
   - Add `npm run test:coverage` check
   - Block commit if threshold not met

3. Add coverage badge to `README.md`

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Tests run on every push/PR
- Coverage report in CI logs
- PRs blocked if coverage drops

---

## Dependencies & Risks

### Dependencies
- ✅ Vitest already installed
- ✅ TypeScript support configured
- ✅ Husky + lint-staged ready
- ⚠️ Need mock libraries (if not already available):
  - `vitest` includes `vi.mock()` built-in ✅
  - May need `@types/node` for testing globals (already installed)

### Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|------------|-----------|
| Mock setup complexity for Cloud APIs | Medium | Use `vi.mock()` stubs; refer to vitest docs |
| Time estimate underestimation | Medium | Allocate 30% buffer; prioritize high-value tests first |
| Pre-existing untestable code | Low | Refactor incrementally on Green passes |
| CI/CD external API mocking | Low | Mock all external calls; use deterministic seeds |

---

## Success Criteria

| Criterion | Target | Current |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| Line Coverage | ≥80% | 28% |
| Function Coverage | ≥80% | ~50% |
| Branch Coverage | ≥75% | ~20% |
| Test Count | ≥30 | 4 |
| All modules tested | 7/7 | 2/7 |
| CI/CD configured | Yes | No |

---

## Timeline

| Phase | Duration | Start | End |
|-------|----------|-------|-----|
| **Phase 1** | 1 day | 2025-10-19 | 2025-10-19 |
| **Phase 2** | 3-4 days | 2025-10-20 | 2025-10-23 |
| **Phase 3** | 1 day | 2025-10-24 | 2025-10-24 |
| **Phase 4** | 1 day | 2025-10-25 | 2025-10-25 (optional) |
| **TOTAL** | ~6 days | 2025-10-19 | 2025-10-25 |
